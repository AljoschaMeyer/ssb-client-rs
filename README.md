# SSB-Client

A client library for interfacing with a [secure-scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) server.

A [working example](https://gist.github.com/AljoschaMeyer/7d0589dbf9fd1f6e9d5955f5fe84d708)
of using static typing for messages. Note that ssb-client-rs need to use version 0.3.1 or newer (the previous examples use 0.3.0).

At lines 40 and 41 there are comments describing how the struct can be changed and how it changes the behavior of the program. This alone is already a good reason for using rust. The performance gains are just a nice bonus.
